Advantages of inheritance:

Inheritance makes the code reusable.

Suppose you put the same code in different classes, but what happens when you have to make changes to a function and in several places?
There is a high likelihood that you will forget some places and bugs will be introduced.
You can avoid this with inheritance, which will ensure that all changes are localized, and inconsistencies are avoided.

Extensibility - Using inheritance, one can extend the base class as per the requirements of the derived class.
It provides an easy way to upgrade or enhance specific parts of a product without changing the core attributes.
An existing class can act as a base class from which a new class with upgraded features can be derived.

Data Hiding - The base class can keep some data private so that the derived class cannot alter it. This concept is called encapsulation.
